## Database overview
The Forest C database (ForC-db) is an open access global C database led by Dr. Kristina Anderson-Teixeira (Smithsonian). ForC is updated and maintained in [this Github repository](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC). The database contains data on ground-based measurements of ecosystem-level C stocks and annual fluxes in forests globally, along with site information, disturbance history, and information on methodology. It currently contains >17,500 records from >2,700 plots and >2,000 sites, making it the largest and most comprehensive database of its type. These data were obtained from multiple previous compilations and individual published studies, as detailed in [Anderson-Teixeira et al. (2016)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.13226/abstract) and an in-prep publication.


![**Geographical distributions of sites included in ForC-db.** Symbols are colored according to the number of records from each site. Underlying map shows coverage of evergreen, deciduous, and mixed forests (from SYNMAP; Jung et al. 2006) and biogeographic zones (Olson et al. 2001). Distribution of sites, plots, and records among biogeographic zones is shown in the inset.](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/blob/master/figures/World_Map_with_Biogeographic_regions_and_sites.png?raw=true)



The tropical component of ForC-db (TropForC-db) has been published in the peer-reviewed literature: [Anderson-Teixeira *et al.* (2016)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13226). Additional data are included in this repository but have not yet been officially published (interested users may contact database PI Dr. Kristina Anderson-Teixeira for an update on status and to discuss collaboration). Moreover, we anticipate database growth as other investigators contribute to the database.

## Data Use 
ForC-db is an open access database, and we encourage use of the data for scientific research and educational purposes. All users are responsible to adhere to the data use policy: [`DATA USE POLICY.md`](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/blob/master/DATA%20USE%20POLICY.md). 


## Contributing to the database 
We anticipate that ForC-db will be of great value for various initiatives seeking to understand and manage the role of tropical forests in the global C cycle, and we encourage authors to contribute data. Please see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
