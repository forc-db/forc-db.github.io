It contains supplementary data including site information, stand ages, and disturbance history. All data were obtained from published, peer-reviewed sources, as detailed in [Anderson-Teixeira et al. (2016)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.13226/abstract) and [Anderson-Teixeira et al. (2018)](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.2229).\n\nForC is updated and maintained in [this Github repository](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC) and may be visualized using our [interactive Shiny app](https://forc.shinyapps.io/global_data_visualization/). \n\n<br>\n\n<center>\n#### 29,713 records  |  4,971 plots  |  3,325 sites\n\n![**Geographical distributions of sites included in ForC-db.** Symbols are colored according to the number of records from each site.

Distribution of sites, plots, and records among biogeographic zones is shown in the inset.](https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/blob/master/figures/World_Map_with_Biogeographic_regions_and_sites.png?raw=true)\n\n\n</center>\n\n\n***\n\n### Funding \n* DOE Terrestrial Ecosystem Science grant DE-SC0008085/ DE-SC0010039 to Kristina Anderson-Teixeira, Evan DeLucia, and Benjamin Duval\n\n* Smithsonian Women's Committee grant to Kristina Anderson-Teixeira\n\n* Smithsonian Scholarly Studies grant to Kristina Anderson-Teixeira and Helene Muller-Landau",
